          <p>
            When I was looking for opportunities that would allow me to use my computer science knowledge, I
            came across your company and began investigating it. I respect the work you do and the fact that
            you are a leader in this field. I've read a lot of reviews about your company, and it appears that your
            employees are enthusiastic about the work environment, the freedom to try new things, and the
            collaborative and diversified work structure your company supports. I'd be honoured to join your
            team and contribute to your further success.
